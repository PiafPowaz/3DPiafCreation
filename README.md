# 3DPiafCreation
Free and Open 3D Creation Software. Use the MultiCode file at https://github.com/PiafPowaz/MultiCode to create source files but isn't necessary.

# Python Dependencies

Pygame and Scipy

# 1.1.0

Allow to use imagex.txt, imagey.txt and imagez.txt to create a 3D object.

# 1.2.0

New feature :

Allow to use only imagex.txt and imagey.txt to create a 3D object. Using imagez.txt without using the two others might get an issue. I will try to fix it if it appears, add it to the To Do list.

Zoom in the 3D object by pressing the key n and zoom out by pressing the key b. Replace keys to mouse scrolling could be nice. Added to the To Do list.

Minimize the number of point by using the key o, that feature will remove point inside the 3D object and then allow to move it faster. This feature might take some time to execute.

Save the 3D object as a .3DPiaf by using the key s. So after Minimize the number of point, the 3D object can be saved to avoid to minimize it each time it's loaded.

Load the 3D object by using the key l. 

# To Do

Fix issues which appears when using imagez.txt without using the two others. 

Replace zoom keys by the mouse scrolling. 

Convert an image file to binary.

Translate the python code into another programming language using if possible MultiCode.

Export the 3D object as .obj, .stl or ... . 

Center the rotation on the object's center.

Translate all the French words into English ones.
